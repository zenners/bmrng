      BOOMERANG IS A NEW (AND SIMPLER) WAY FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS TO PROOF
      THEIR IMAGES TO THEIR CLIENTS AND INCREASE THEIR SALES.
    </p>
    <p>
      CUSTOMER'S GET ALL THE FUNCTION THEY WANT AND NONE OF THE NOISE THEY
      DON'T. IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN INSIGHTS THAT SOME
      OF OUR PHOTOGRAPHERS HAVE USED TO AS MUCH AS
      <b>
        DOUBLE THEIR ORDER TOTALS.

          Boomerang is beautiful. Clean lines and minimalist design make our
          interface take a backseat to your images, exactly like it should because
          we recognize that even the way you proff should get you more leads and
          help you book more clients.

        <p>
          You should know things like what photos are your customer's favorites
          and what their budget is before they ever come back in to order. Our
          software makes that easy and gives you an advantage in maximizing
          sales potential.

          Your customer should never be bored with their images. In fact, you should
          be giving them every opportunity you can to make them even more excited
          about them. Smooth animations, familiar gestures and an impossibly
          solid backend make sure they are.

          One of our goals was to make the proofing experience so great for your
          clients that their friends want to book you just so they can have the same
          experience themselves. Boomerang lets people easily share their session
          with a direct link to your site. Traffic.

            Boomerang lets you ask questions of your clients after they're
          done viewing their session, right in-app. This, along with analytics
          for which sessions and images are most popular with help you
          prepare for orders and gather tons of important data about your
          sessions.

          It's 2014, clients should have been able to view their images on their
          mobile devices years ago. We've made Boomerang responsive and
          familiar on your phone or tablet. All without any apps to download
          or requests to connect through Facebook.

          We hate feature checklists and forcing our subscribers to think
          about things like limits on files or storage contstraints. We have
          one plan for unlimited access to everything. And no tier-tricks to
          get you to bump up and give us more money later.

          We're straight shooters and we believe that people should pay for good
          work (like yours). Our pricing is simple and month-to-month (unless
          you want to save some cash and pay for a year up front). Buy your
          first month and cancel anytime.
